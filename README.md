# üí° Problem Statement

According to recent data from top streaming service <i> <b> Netflix </b> </i>; 70% of the users on the platform binge watch shows. A large chunk of the viewership comes from the youth age groups in between 15-27 years. We incorporated a chrome extension to help you control your binge habits with the help of a reward system. Based on points gained from tasks that simulate physical / mental activity, you can earn watch time which can be used to keep you accountable for the watch time.

Many people have contacted us asking if they can use this code for their own websites. The answer to that question is usually "yes", with attribution. There are some cases, such as using this code for a business or something that is greater than a personal project, that we may be less comfortable saying yes to. If in doubt, please don't hesitate to ask us.

We value keeping this site open source, but as you all know, _**plagiarism is bad**_. We spent a non-negligible amount of effort developing, designing, and trying to perfect this iteration of our website, and we are proud of it! All we ask is to not claim this effort as your own.
